# IPL-score-predictor
\



This project is an IPL Score Predictor web application built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It uses machine learning techniques to predict the final score of an IPL innings based on current match conditions such as runs, wickets, overs completed, and batting/bowling teams. The model is trained on historical IPL match data and provides near real-time predictions through a user-friendly web interface.


Technologies Used:
Python – Core programming language

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and preprocessing

Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

Streamlit – Interactive front-end for the prediction app

Matplotlib/Seaborn – Data visualization (optional)
